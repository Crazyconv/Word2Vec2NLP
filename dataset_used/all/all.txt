yea, not a very good time to be in need of a new MBP or Air. Hoping the Skylake update makes up for it.

They feel good. A little less travel than the MBP keys, but not much. Not like the MacBook. I can type fast on the new keyboard.

agree. The new XPS without the border on the screen looks good. Still no MBP though ????

Twice as powerful as the equivalent MBP? Surface must have some really good internals.
I wonder if the new Surface Book trackpad is finally good? For some reason Windows trackpads are horrible compared to the MBP.
The new Lumia Phones look good, but that Surface Book announced looks Awesome and should give the MBP a good run for the money.
When you think about it, Apple has to have a good rebuttal to this Surface Book? It's been years since the MBP got a re-design.

What MBP is good enough for FCPX?
Anyone tried ? Good? Can I use for Mac extended screen - iMac &gt;&gt; MBP?!
which model? i'm running the air, still have never tasted the good life of a mbp :(

3 presentations Friday at the Tulsa Tech festival. Good time to upgrade the MBA to Yosemite and install Win 10 on the MBP, right?
Earlier â€œbrickingâ€ of MBP was due to an out of date kernel extension. Its all good now. Kids, Update VirtualBox regularly!
I changed from a 15.4" Acer to my 13" MBP, I think it's just good enough. You'll enjoy it once you get used to it.
I replaced the trackpad in my MBP. Good as new and I didn't lose any of those almost invisible tiny screws.

Good Morning and still waiting for the arrival of the VH-MBP.. nmpak x muka org x tidur dgn mata bengkak ????
Youâ€™re better than I. Though I do edit on my 15â€ MBP screen and theyâ€™re generally good in terms of color repro.
nooooooooo!!!!! I'm sorry :( They have some good deals on refurbs, I just got a MBair for 1100, MBP was 1300
Google Chrome is the only app that can get my MBP fans spinning at full blast for no good reason. Donâ€™t think the updater needs 110% CPUâ€¦
Yeah, thankfully they're good about fixes, just an inconvenience right now. I have a MBP and PC tower to cover.
It's always seemed pretty good when watching on stage. MBP should be here tomorrow!
Yeah. I almost exclusively use my MBP for programming. 8 years of desktop Linux make it hard to program without good terminal.
Right? Background scrolling is long overdue. If the command line situation was 1/2 as good as OS X, I'd ditch my MBP. But... :(
I'm torn. I think both are good fits. Windows 10 is a huge +! I own 0 Apple products now. i7/128 SP3 same $ as i5/128 MBP.
Accidentally ordered a new mbp. To be fair, my current is a late 2008 model. I'd say a 7 year lifespan is pretty damn good for a laptop.
I think so, thereâ€™s a Mac for everyone which is good: for people who need portsâ€”the MBP, for those who donâ€™tâ€”the MacBook.
The good news is, aside from the outrageous cost, the new laptops are AMAZING. I got a new MBP in June and it's the best.
MBP's trackpad is so good, missing touch isn't an issue.
good evening fello mbp user. :)
and what about mbp 13 is it good to replace both
Hwoops, screwed up the mbp on the desktop. Good thing I've got the laptop to make an installation usb stick. XD
yeah been thinking of getting a mbp retina. still not sure. Elgato? It's a good lil device. Streaming qual sucks a bit
Pulling teeth getting MBP 12,1 to play well with It's been a good experience, though. I'm finally installing apps.
Oh why don't you have a App yet? Just started using on my WP and MBP and it seems to be working good.
I should note this is an end-of-life MBP: Apple don't supply OSX updates for it anymore. Thought it was worth trying, as hardware is good.
ur always looking good AF UR MBP DUH
Power cord is throwing bright green sparks for my MBP, probably not good
A 16GB MBP is a good, portable #VIRL system, depending on your topology. See
Thought I lost my MBP display today. Disaster averted. Good thing Iâ€™m known as the Mac Whisperer :P
Good news: I've successfully updated the VM on my MBP to #Windows10. Bad news: I'll need to buy a new SDD for my old Vaio to update that.
quick question.. is the performance of a VM good enough for programming? (15â€³ MBP 2015 with i7)
I have 2 my iMac is good but my new one doesnâ€™t like the new MBP
Yeah, was looking at a 15 MBP but I think I'd like a non Apple... Sadly there aren't many good dev books out there!
It's battery backup is not good as MBA or MBP isn't ?
