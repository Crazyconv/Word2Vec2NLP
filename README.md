# Word2Vec2NLP
Using Word2Vec for sentiment analysis

## requirements

all in python, check requirements.txt for libraries used

## features

* support multi-file data set

* have both sequential and parallel versions for building doc vector

## issues

* insufficient text processing options, need to check with other members

> I have a **text processing** in util.py - process()

* lack normalization for doc vector, will do experiment to get performance statistics in later stages
